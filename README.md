# DL-MakeitSimple

This repository would help to have a quick insight of different Machine and Deep Learning concepts. 
On Futher, it helps you to dive deep into the concepts.

Major advantange of this is that you can try straight away on the notebook by opening it on the Colab. It would give you a clear instructions with recent working libraries

Hope you would enjoy it.
Any suggestions are Welcomed.

# Best Practices
 1. Always have a Separate import section at the start of the code or Notebook.
 2. Follow PEP8 -- Style Guide for Python Code 



# Some Image dataset preprocessing steps
 1. [Erosion](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/imgproc/erosion_dilatation/erosion_dilatation.html)
 2. Dilusion
 3. [Increasing the brightness or bluring the image.](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.2/df/d9d/tutorial_py_colorspaces.html) (cv.medianBlur, cv.cvtColor, cv.threshold)
 4. [OpenCV Image Filter methods ](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_morphological_ops/py_morphological_ops.html)
